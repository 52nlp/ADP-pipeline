This version is a bit different from the original treebank. In this version, the direct object structure representation has been changed. In this representation, "ra" is not the head of the object word. Instead, "ra" is regarded as the "case marker" for the direct object (dependent of "ra" in the original representation). The conversion has been done automatically; therefore, there may be some potential errors.Example:کتاب را خواند.Orginial:خواند--> رارا --> کتابAlternative representation:خواند--> کتابکتاب --> را
