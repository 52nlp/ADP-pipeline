  "My fellow citizens: At this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century.",
  "It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs--a moment that will define our course, and our character, for decades to come.",
  "We must keep our old democracy forever young.",
  "Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of new promise.",
  "The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal.",
  "It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved the union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.",
  "Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American Century.",
  "And what a century it has been.",
  "America became the world's mightiest industrial power; saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war; and time and again, reached out across the globe to millions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.",
  "Along the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer and the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities, and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.",
  "Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to choose.",
  "We began the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation from coast to coast.",
  "We began the 20th century with a choice, to harness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise, conservation, and human decency.",
  "Those choices made all the difference.",
  "At the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the Information Age and the global society, to unleash the limitless potential of all our people, and, yes, to form a more perfect union.",
  "When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today.",
  "We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation.",
  "In these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge, strengthened by achievement.",
  "America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation.",
  "Once again, our economy is the strongest on Earth.",
  "Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment.",
  "Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts: our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work.",
  "And once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government.",
  "Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution.",
  "We--the American people--we are the solution.",
  "Our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day.",
  "As times change, so government must change.",
  "We need a new government for a new century--humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves; a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and does more with less.",
  "Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less.",
  "The preeminent mission of our new government is to give all Americans an opportunity--not a guarantee, but a real opportunity--to build better lives.",
  "Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us.",
  "Our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship.",
  "And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century.",
  "There is work to do, work that government alone cannot do: teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls; coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of our own lives to serve others.",
  "Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility--not only for ourselves and our families, but for our neighbors and our nation.",
  "Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century.",
  "For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America.",
  "The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future--will we be one nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not?",
  "Will we all come together, or come apart?",
  "The divide of race has been America's constant curse.",
  "And each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices.",
  "Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different.",
  "These forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the past.",
  "They plague us still.",
  "They fuel the fanaticism of terror.",
  "And they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world.",
  "These obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who are hated, robbing both of what they might become.",
  "We cannot, we will not, succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere.",
  "We shall overcome them.",
  "And we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.",
  "Our rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be a Godsend in the 21st century.",
  "Great rewards will come to those who can live together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind together.",
  "As this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines.",
  "Ten years ago, the Internet was the mystical province of physicists; today, it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren.",
  "Scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life.",
  "Cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand.",
  "The world is no longer divided into two hostile camps.",
  "Instead, now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries.",
  "Growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over.",
  "And for the very first time in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship.",
  "My fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we may ask, can we hope not just to follow, but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy?",
  "To that question, every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding Yes.",
  "This is the heart of our task.",
  "With a new vision of government, a new sense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain America's journey.",
  "The promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise.",
  "In this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized possession.",
  "Our schools will have the highest standards in the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy.",
  "And the doors of higher education will be open to all.",
  "The knowledge and power of the Information Age will be within reach not just of the few, but of every classroom, every library, every child.",
  "Parents and children will have time not only to work, but to read and play together.",
  "And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college.",
  "Our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore.",
  "Everyone who can work, will work, with today's permanent under class part of tomorrow's growing middle class.",
  "New miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now, but the children and hardworking families too long denied.",
  "We will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction.",
  "Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.",
  "Ports and airports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas.",
  "And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies.",
  "Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations--a nation that balances its budget, but never loses the balance of its values.",
  "A nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time.",
  "A nation that fortifies the world's most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water, air, and majestic land.",
  "And in this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests--regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all Americans.",
  "Fellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens.",
  "Prosperity and power--yes, they are important, and we must maintain them.",
  "But let us never forget: The greatest progress we have made, and the greatest progress we have yet to make, is in the human heart.",
  "In the end, all the world's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit.",
  "Thirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there, at the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the conscience of a nation.",
  "Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart.",
  "Martin Luther King's dream was the American Dream.",
  "His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed.",
  "Our history has been built on such dreams and labors.",
  "And by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of America in the 21st century.",
  "To that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office.",

  "text": "My fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nAt this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift\r\nour eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century. It is\r\nour great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the\r\nedge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright\r\nnew prospect in human affairs--a moment that will define our course,\r\nand our character, for decades to come. We must keep our old democracy\r\nforever young. Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us\r\nset our sights upon a land of new promise.\r\n\r\nThe promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold\r\nconviction that we are all created equal. It was extended and preserved\r\nin the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved\r\nthe union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.\r\n\r\nThen, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage\r\nto make this the American Century.\r\n\r\nAnd what a century it has been. America became the world's mightiest\r\nindustrial power; saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and\r\na long cold war; and time and again, reached out across the globe to\r\nmillions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in\r\nold age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools\r\nto all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer\r\nand the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a\r\nrevolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities, and\r\nextending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.\r\n\r\nNow, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to\r\nchoose. We began the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation\r\nfrom coast to coast. We began the 20th century with a choice, to\r\nharness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise,\r\nconservation, and human decency. Those choices made all the difference.\r\nAt the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape\r\nthe forces of the Information Age and the global society, to unleash the\r\nlimitless potential of all our people, and, yes, to form a more perfect\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nWhen last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain\r\nthan it does today. We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIn these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by\r\nchallenge, strengthened by achievement. America stands alone as the\r\nworld's indispensable nation. Once again, our economy is the strongest\r\non Earth. Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving\r\ncommunities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment.\r\nProblems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts:\r\nour streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have\r\nmoved from welfare to work.\r\n\r\nAnd once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the\r\nrole of government. Today we can declare: Government is not the problem,\r\nand government is not the solution. We--the American people--we are\r\nthe solution. Our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy\r\nstrong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our\r\ncommon challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day.\r\n\r\nAs times change, so government must change. We need a new government for\r\na new century--humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for\r\nus, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for\r\nourselves; a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and\r\ndoes more with less. Yet where it can stand up for our values and\r\ninterests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to\r\nmake a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do\r\nmore, not less. The preeminent mission of our new government is to\r\ngive all Americans an opportunity--not a guarantee, but a real\r\nopportunity--to build better lives.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us. Our founders\r\ntaught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends\r\nupon responsible citizenship. And we need a new sense of responsibility\r\nfor a new century. There is work to do, work that government alone\r\ncannot do: teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls;\r\ncoming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help\r\nreclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of\r\nour own lives to serve others.\r\n\r\nEach and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal\r\nresponsibility--not only for ourselves and our families, but for our\r\nneighbors and our nation. Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a\r\nnew spirit of community for a new century. For any one of us to succeed,\r\nwe must succeed as one America.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future--will we\r\nbe one nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not? Will we all\r\ncome together, or come apart?\r\n\r\nThe divide of race has been America's constant curse. And each new\r\nwave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices. Prejudice and\r\ncontempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction\r\nare no different. These forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the\r\npast. They plague us still. They fuel the fanaticism of terror. And they\r\ntorment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world.\r\n\r\nThese obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who\r\nare hated, robbing both of what they might become. We cannot, we will\r\nnot, succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the\r\nsoul everywhere. We shall overcome them. And we shall replace them with\r\nthe generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.\r\n\r\nOur rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be\r\na Godsend in the 21st century. Great rewards will come to those who can\r\nlive together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAs this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines. Ten\r\nyears ago, the Internet was the mystical province of physicists;\r\ntoday, it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren.\r\nScientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life. Cures for our\r\nmost feared illnesses seem close at hand.\r\n\r\nThe world is no longer divided into two hostile camps. Instead, now we\r\nare building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries. Growing\r\nconnections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the\r\nfortunes and spirits of people the world over. And for the very first\r\ntime in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy\r\nthan dictatorship.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we\r\nmay ask, can we hope not just to follow, but even to surpass the\r\nachievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful\r\nbloodshed that stained its legacy? To that question, every American here\r\nand every American in our land today must answer a resounding \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the heart of our task. With a new vision of government, a new\r\nsense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain\r\nAmerica's journey. The promise we sought in a new land we will find\r\nagain in a land of new promise.\r\n\r\nIn this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized\r\npossession. Our schools will have the highest standards in the world,\r\nigniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and\r\nevery boy. And the doors of higher education will be open to all. The\r\nknowledge and power of the Information Age will be within reach not just\r\nof the few, but of every classroom, every library, every child. Parents\r\nand children will have time not only to work, but to read and play\r\ntogether. And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those\r\nof a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college.\r\n\r\nOur streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because\r\nno one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore. Everyone\r\nwho can work, will work, with today's permanent under class part of\r\ntomorrow's growing middle class. New miracles of medicine at last\r\nwill reach not only those who can claim care now, but the children and\r\nhardworking families too long denied.\r\n\r\nWe will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong\r\ndefense against terror and destruction. Our children will sleep free\r\nfrom the threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Ports and\r\nairports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and\r\nideas. And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of\r\ndemocracies.\r\n\r\nOur land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations--a\r\nnation that balances its budget, but never loses the balance of its\r\nvalues. A nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and\r\nhealth care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms\r\nnecessary to sustain those benefits for their time. A nation that\r\nfortifies the world's most productive economy even as it protects the\r\ngreat natural bounty of our water, air, and majestic land.\r\n\r\nAnd in this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics so\r\nthat the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of\r\nnarrow interests--regaining the participation and deserving the trust of\r\nall Americans.\r\n\r\nFellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward\r\ntoward realizing the full potential of all its citizens. Prosperity and\r\npower--yes, they are important, and we must maintain them. But let\r\nus never forget: The greatest progress we have made, and the greatest\r\nprogress we have yet to make, is in the human heart. In the end, all the\r\nworld's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and\r\ndecency of the human spirit.\r\n\r\nThirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to\r\nus down there, at the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the\r\nconscience of a nation. Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream\r\nthat one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals\r\nbefore the law and in the heart. Martin Luther King's dream was the\r\nAmerican Dream. His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to\r\nlive out our true creed. Our history has been built on such dreams\r\nand labors. And by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of\r\nAmerica in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nTo that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office.\r\nI ask the members of Congress here to join in that pledge. The American\r\npeople returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of\r\nanother. Surely, they did not do this to advance the politics of petty\r\nbickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore. No, they\r\ncall on us instead to be repairers of the breach, and to move on with\r\nAmerica's mission.\r\n\r\nAmerica demands and deserves big things from us--and nothing big ever\r\ncame from being small. Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal\r\nBernardin, when facing the end of his own life. He said:\r\n\r\n\"It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time, on acrimony and\r\ndivision.\"\r\n\r\nFellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time. For\r\nall of us are on that same journey of our lives, and our journey, too,\r\nwill come to an end. But the journey of our America must go on.\r\n\r\nAnd so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to\r\ndare. The demands of our time are great and they are different. Let us\r\nmeet them with faith and courage, with patience and a grateful and happy\r\nheart. Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our\r\nhistory. Yes, let us build our bridge. A bridge wide enough and strong\r\nenough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nMay those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we\r\nmay never know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new\r\ncentury with the American Dream alive for all her children; with the\r\nAmerican promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people;\r\nwith America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFrom the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go\r\nforth. May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead--and always,\r\nalways bless our America.\r\n",
