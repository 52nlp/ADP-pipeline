         "Running a blue state between 2003 and 2007, Romney governed to the right of the campaign he had run, moved steadily in a pro-life direction, cut taxes and spending, and gave the state a more conservative government. ", 
         "Now he presents himself as an authentic pragmatic conservative, who sells himself as the market requires, who governs based on his business experience, who moved a blue state as far to the right as was humanly possible, and whose skills at financial management uniquely equip him to achieve the conservative goals of cutting back spending, reforming entitlements, and reviving a broken economy. ", 
         "This makes him an operational conservative, whose works bend the world in a rightward direction, but without the ideological grounding underneath. ", 
         "The question is, is this sufficient? ", 
         "The answer may be yes, and no."
