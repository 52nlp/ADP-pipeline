Severe poverty is a prison sentence , condemning children to mental and physical health problems , feelings of hopelessness and long term desperation .
The reality of police violence against poor people and especially against poor people that are resisting their life sentence of poverty raises difficult questions .
Poverty is a thief of self-esteem no matter what race one belongs to , or what the colour of ones skin .
Poverty is a thief , robbing children of what they require to thrive .
