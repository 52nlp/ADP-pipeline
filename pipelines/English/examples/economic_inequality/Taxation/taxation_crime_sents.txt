Murray Rothbard argued in The Ethics of Liberty that taxation is theft and that tax resistance is therefore legitimate: "Just as no one is morally required to answer a robber truthfully when he asks if there are any valuables in oneâ€™s house, so no one can be morally required to answer truthfully similar questions asked by the State, e.g., when filling out income tax returns."
In closing, we need therefore to properly remind many people that a future PDC Government will ABOLISH ALL TAXATION in order to liberate them and others from this evil scourge of TAXATION, and in order therefore to bring greater freedom and democracy and development to the people of this country.
Throughout his life, Harry Moore spoke out in public and in print, in meetings and church services, in letters to newspapers, magazines and public officials, and by every other means at his disposal, against the injustices that blacks endured, from lynching to employment discrimination to the scourge of taxation without representation via the institutional racism and grassroots terrorism that kept black people locked out of the political process.
