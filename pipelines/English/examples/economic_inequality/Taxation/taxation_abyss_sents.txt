If Rep. Ryan is unable or unwilling to fill his $6 trillion tax hole, and if he is unable to make his $900 billion in additional nondefense discretionary cuts stick, then far from reducing the deficit, the Ryan budget would actually result in deficits averaging 4.3 percent of GDP through 2023, and the debt-to-GDP ratio continuing to rise ever year for the next 10 years.
The newly released House Republican budget plan, authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), claims to achieve balance by 2023, but that’s only true if you ignore the $6 trillion tax hole, and the utterly unrealistic cuts to a category of federal spending that’s already set to decline to historic lows.
I'm "outraged" now because we have stupidly opened the door to what will become the nations largest entitlement program, and like all others will become a huge burecracy that will grow and turn into a bottomless tax pit that will forever grow the debt as we realize we will never be able to stay ahead of the costs.
