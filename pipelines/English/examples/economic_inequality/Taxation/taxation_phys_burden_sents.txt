My local and state taxes are crushing me because my schools, local governments, and the state are bloated, corrupt, and inefficient and will not control costs.
Also I actually said to Liz yesterday that I would never go back to paying players even if we get the Tax millstone from our necks.
Western Australia began letting local governments shift their whole tax burden to land in 1902, and this system is now widely used. 
And even here, as this additional state-level data for North Carolina shows, those North Carolinians not paying federal income taxes are overwhelming working households who did pay payroll taxes, the elderly who paid taxes in their lifetime and students who are very likely to pay taxes when they enter the workforce.
