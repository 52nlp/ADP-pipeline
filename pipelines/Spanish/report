Negation


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ISSUES:
Juan da a María un libro.
In Spanish, the patient or recipient is always marked with a preposition. So, should the third argument of the verb remain empty?

Juan preguntó dónde María leyo.
"For now, leave "where" out." (from pipelines/readme)
     - "donde" is tagged as an adverb, and thus is marked as modifying "leyo"

The two word sentences ("Juan correro", etc.) do not parse correctly

Verb tense is not currently made explicit by the tools in the pipeline
Number (plurality) is not currently made explicit by the tools in the pipeline

Treetagger tags "newspaper" as an ADJ -> changing readme sentences to use the word "magazine"
