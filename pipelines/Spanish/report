ISSUES:
Juan da a María un libro.
In Spanish, the patient or recipient is always marked with a preposition. So, should the third argument of the verb remain empty?

Juan preguntó dónde María leyo.
"For now, leave "where" out." (from pipelines/readme)
     - "donde" is tagged as an adverb, and thus is marked as modifying "leyo"
