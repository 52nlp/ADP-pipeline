Farsi discourse processing pipeline:

A pipeline that tokenizes (to be added), POS tags, Parses and creates logical form for farsi sentences.

The tagger is stanford's tagger and the parser is MALT parser.
The tagger and the parser are trained on persian dependency treebank.

Tokenizing, tagging, parsing and LF generation can be invoked individually or altogether in a sequence using the LF_Pipeline module . It is also possible to pipe the output of each module to the next module. 

A. Running the pipeline:

1. It is necessary to set the environmental variabe METAPHOR_DIR to the root folder of the Metaphor-ADP project, eg:
	
	export METAPHOR_DIR=/Users/niloofar/Metaphor-ADP

It is also necessary that the input file name be absolute.

2. Command for running the pipeline:

   ./LF_Pipeline [<input file>][<output file>]

if input and/or output files are not given as arguments, they are read from standard stream.

Sample commands:

./LF_Pipeline $METAPHOR_DIR/pipelines/Farsi/samples/sentence.txt /Users/niloofar/Metaphor-ADP/pipelines/Farsi/samples/lf.txt

cat $METAPHOR_DIR/pipelines/Farsi/samples/sentence.txt |./LF_Pipeline > $METAPHOR_DIR/pipelines/Farsi/samples/lf.txt   

B. Running individual modules:

Again it is necessary to have METAPHOR_DIR point to the root folder of the Metaphor-ADP project. 

The input file name should be absolute.

If input and/or output files are not given as arguments, they are read from standard stream.

1. Command for running the tokenizer
	./tokenize [<input file>][<output file>]


2. Command for running the tagger
	./tag [<input file>][<output file>]

3. Command for running the parser
	./parse [<input file>][<output file>]

2. Command for running the LF generator
	./createLF [<input file>][<output file>]
